   Hi, I'm Dr. Br채m<br>
   I'm an interdisciplinary scientist in the fields of pharmacometrics and machine learning. Already during my studies in pharmaceutical sciences at ETH Z체rich, I was strongly interested in pharmacometrics, programming, and machine learning. After my graduation, I pursued these interests during an internship in the pharmacometrics department at Roche and then further during my PhD. I successfully defended my PhD thesis with the title <i> Novel Integration of Machine Learning and Pharmacometric Approaches to Facilitate Data Analyses in Clinical Research and Drug Development </i> in 2024 at the University Childrens Hospital Basel. My interdisciplinary expertise, my analytical way of thinking, my collaborative mindset, and my enthusiasm to learn new things make me a scientist that is able to solve (almost) any problem he is confronted with.

   Hi, I'm Ringo<br>
   Being a scout is such a big part of me that it gets its own section here. Joining the scouts when I was 6 years old, I can't imagine how my life would look like without being Ringo (yes, in Switzerland every scout gets a special scout name). As a scout, I learned taking care of the nature and other people. During my time as scout leader and later group and section leader of our scout association, I learned taking responsibilities, organize and lead people. One major lesson that I internalised from my scout experiences is that to achieve success we need to advance as a team by recognizing and fostering the strengths of each person independent of their age, experience, or background.
